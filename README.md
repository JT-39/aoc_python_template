# Advent of code Python template

## Getting set up

1. Please clone this repo or fork it to your own github account.

## How to use this template

### Set up the test

1. Put the test data as a .txt file in the `test_data` folder.
2. Create a `tests/test_day_{day}.py` file and write your test.
3. Create a `day_{day}.py` file and write your function.
4. Run your test by running `pytest tests` in your terminal. It is normal and ok to fail the test at first!

### Work on your solution

5. Work on improving your function and run your test till your functon works.
6. Once it passes the test, create your real data file in the `real_data` folder. Copy and paste your data from the aoc website.
7. Run your function with the full data by uncommenting the lines.
8. Put your answer into the AOC website - hopefully you've got your star! ‚≠ê
